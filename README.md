### Hi! I'm Bruno Antenucci and I'm looking to start a career in web development
### In order to do so I completed Henry, a challenging 4 month bootcamp where I've learned the fundamentals of programming, data structures and algorithms using tecnologies such as JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, Sequelize, Mongoose, React, Redux, HTML and CSS
### Besides the tech I have a lot of other skills aquired in my old career in the travel industry that can translate well in the development business
### Let's meet!
